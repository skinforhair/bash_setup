#!/bin/bash
# Version 8.4
# 20 May 2015
#
# For each RHEL 4/5/6/7 there are appropriate tzdata packages that should be installed.
# 4: tzdata-2015a-1.el4
# 5: tzdata-2015a-1.el5
# 6: tzdata-2015a-1.el6
# 7: tzdata-2015a-1.el7
#
# Since the correct version is the same for all major releases, check that the 
# installed tzdata rpm is from 2015 (as the 2015a-1 is the first tzdata release of 2015)
#
# If there are outdated tzdata packages, check to see if the localtime file indicates
# that the tzdata package needs to be or may need to be updated for the Leap Second.
#
# Check for the proper kernel versions as well - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4/5/6 may have 
# potential issues depending on the installed kernel.
#
# For ntp, potential issues with -x or 'slew time' may not work as expected:
# RHEL 7: All NTP Packages are currently affected.
# RHEL 6: Affected are ntp-4.2.6p5-1 and ntp-4.2.6p5-2
# RHEL 5: None affected
