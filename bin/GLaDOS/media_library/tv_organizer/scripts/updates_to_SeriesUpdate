check if .showdata files exist.
 - if they exist, check their age
 

-if older than n days, or they don't exist update episode json
 - when updating, if I have a tvdbid, search by that, otherwise do the current search by name

store json variables seperately from db variables

json takes precidence on 
  seasons aired
  tvdb id
  imdb id
  on-air status

db takes presidence on
 active download

current size_on_disk takes precidence

if any of the variables differ from the current db, update it

allow me to change seasons_owned, seasones_aired, currently_on_air, and active_download

special case: if the show name has changed, update the db, warn user to move files
